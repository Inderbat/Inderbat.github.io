I am a Research Associate at [Adobe Research Labs, Bangalore](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) working on a wide range of Machine Learning projects in Document intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Information Extraction and Legal Artificial Intelligence. I recieved my Bachelor of Technology (BTech.) in Electrical Engineering with Minor in Computer Science and Engineering from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay (IIT Bombay)](https://www.iitb.ac.in/) in 2021.


## Research

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and related fields. At Adobe, I have primarily worked in document intelligence projects involving NLP techniques like semantic / topical structure analysis and information extraction. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with [Prof. Suyash Awate](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~suyash/index.html#teaching) to repurpose a generative modelling framework for the task of one-class classification and anomaly detection. Under the guidance of [Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/), I worked in developing a PAC algorithm for mode estimation of discrete distribution with efficient sample complexity.
